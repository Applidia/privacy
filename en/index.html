      <!-- ========== SOFTWARE QUALIFICATION NOTE ========== -->
      <div class="doc-content doc-qualification">
        <h1>Software Qualification Note</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: 12.06.2025</em></p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> "Applidia" Application – Non-qualification as a Medical Device</p>
        <p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Applidia Sàrl</p>
        <p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Lausanne, Switzerland</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>1. Context</h2>
          <p>The Applidia application is a mobile software developed to support individuals with diabetes in tracking their personal health data (e.g., blood glucose, injections, blood pressure, physical activity), for self-monitoring purposes, without automated analysis or diagnostic, predictive, or therapeutic decision-making functions.</p>
          <p>This note aims to demonstrate that Applidia does not meet the definition of a medical device under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and the Swiss MedDO, and therefore does not fall within their scope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>2. Regulatory Definition of a Medical Device</h2>
          <p>According to Article 2 of the MDR (EU 2017/745): A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, software, implant, reagent, or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used for specific medical purposes, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment, or alleviation of a disease.</li>
            <li>Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Under Swiss legislation (MedDO RS 812.213): The definition is equivalent to that of the MDR, as Switzerland is aligned with the EU in the field of medical devices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>3. Applidia Application Features</h2>
          <p>The Applidia application allows the user to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Manually record health data (blood glucose, injections, medications, etc.)</li>
            <li>View trends as graphs or lists</li>
            <li>Use data for personal purposes or to share with a healthcare professional</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The application does not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer any diagnosis or treatment</li>
            <li>Use any clinical decision support algorithms</li>
            <li>Substitute for medical advice in any way</li>
            <li>Provide any automated medical recommendations</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>4. Regulatory Analysis</h2>
          <p>According to the European Commission guidelines (MEDDEV 2.1/6, MDCG 2019-11), software is not considered a medical device if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Its sole purpose is general well-being or personal health monitoring</li>
            <li>It does not alter medical management</li>
            <li>It performs no therapeutic, diagnostic, or predictive function</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Applidia is limited to personal, informational use, without a medical purpose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The Applidia application, in its current state of functionality:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>is not intended for a medical purpose within the meaning of the MDR or MedDO,</li>
            <li>does not alter the medical management of patients,</li>
            <li>is comparable to a personal well-being/health application, similar to a digital paper logbook.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Therefore, Applidia does not constitute a medical device and is not subject to the requirement for CE marking for medical devices or compliance with MDR/MedDO.</p>
